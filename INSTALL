Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan DateTime::Event::Holiday::US

## Manual installation

As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball, untar it,
then build it:

    % perl Build.PL
    % ./Build && ./Build test

Then install it:

    % ./Build install

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

    % sudo ./Build install
